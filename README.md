# CampusVasaLunch
Node.js Facebook bot that fetches lunch for some of the restaurants at the Vasa campus area

To be able to run the bot on your own Node.js server you will need to setup a Facebook messenger bot for one of your own Facebook pages.
The page that you test on does not need to be public. More info on this can be found at facebook's own developer pages.

The application uses the Node.js process environment variables (process.env.VARIABLE_HERE)
The following vars are used:

* GRAPH_API_ACCESS_TOKEN
* PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN
* VERIFY_TOKEN

The vars can be obtained by follwing Facebooks messenger bot guide.
